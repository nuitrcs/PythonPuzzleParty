# Python Puzzle Party 🥳

**What?** Join other Northwestern Python coders in-person on the Evanston campus to solve fun puzzles. Bring a group of friends to compete as a team or come alone. All Python coders are welcome - beginner through advanced. We will provide snacks, coding puzzles for you to solve, and small prizes for the winners! This is a great way to challenge yourself and test out your Python skills.

**When?** Wednesday, November 29, 2023, 3 - 5pm CT

**Who?** All Northwestern students, staff, and faculty are invited to participate. Attendance will be limited to room size, so you must register to attend. The exact location on the Evanston campus is still TBA - the location will be emailed to all registered participants before the workshop.
