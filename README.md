# Python Puzzle Party 🥳🐍🏆

**Instructions:**

There are a total of 6 puzzles. 🧩 They start easier and get harder. So get ready! 💪🏼 Some of the puzzles have an easy and a hard version. You can pick which one to tackle depending on your proficiency. Please note that the easier version is worth less points.

The notebook for each puzzle has specific instructions for that puzzle. The notebook also mentions how many points the puzzle is worth.

You can download the notebooks for the puzzles or work in the cloud with Google Colab. Either way works. Please do note that if you work on your computer, you'll need to install the libraries involved in the puzzles. Google Colab already has them installed. In this sense, working on Google Colab might be a bit easier. Your choice though! 🫵🏼
